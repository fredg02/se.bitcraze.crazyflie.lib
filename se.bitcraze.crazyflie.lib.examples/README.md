# Crazyflie Java library examples

This project contains the Java equivalent of the examples in the [Crazyflie Python client](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python).
 
Therefore they are heavily based on the Python implementation.

## Run the examples

### In Eclipse

Execute an example by right-clicking on it and selecting **Run As** -> **Java Application**

**Please make sure that a Crazyradio (PA) is connected and a Crazyflie is switched on, when running the examples.**
(otherwise they will fail)  

* You might need to adjust the radio channel in the main method of the example classes, by default it's set to channel 80.
